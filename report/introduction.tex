\section{Introduction}
Brain stroke is a disease that lead to 11\% of total deaths and is the $2^{nd}$ cause of death 
according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Early detection of stroke is critical in order to 
reduce the risk of death for patients. This study uses a dataset of personal and medical data for 
more than $5000$ patients. Using machine learning approaches, this study will show how stroke could 
be diagnosed.\\

In a first part, the dataset will be presented. Secondly, feature selection and engineering is 
applied to calibrate the dataset in a better-suited form for machine learning algorithms. Thirdly the 
machine learning algorithms used in this study are introducted and the results presented. Finally, to 
conclude, some interpretation of the results are presented.
