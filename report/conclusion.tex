\section{Conclusion}
This study used a dataset of personal and medical data of more than $5 000$ patients in order to 
predict the event of stroke. After data analysis and feature selection, three machine learning models 
have been trained and tested. Results show that a linear approach is sufficient in order to accuratly 
predict a stroke event for a patient. The model do however predicts a high rate of false positives 
wich will lead to further clinical testing to patients that actually are not at risk of stroke. In 
medical studies, such prediction is best.
