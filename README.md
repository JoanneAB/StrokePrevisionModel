## What is it ?

This study used a dataset of personal and medical data of more than $5 000$ patients in order to 
predict the event of stroke. After data analysis and feature selection, three machine learning models 
have been trained and tested. Results show that a linear approach is sufficient in order to accuratly 
predict a stroke event for a patient. The model do however predicts a high rate of false positives 
wich will lead to further clinical testing to patients that actually are not at risk of stroke. In 
medical studies, such prediction is best. 

A full report is availaible ???.

## How to use it ?

This study uses python libraries and can be run either using the jupyter-notebook project_stroke.ipynb or 
the python script project_stroke.py and the library project_ML_DSTI.
